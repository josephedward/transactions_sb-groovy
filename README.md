# transactions_sb-groovy

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use Spring Boot and Spring Integration to implement a transactional flow.
The assignment is to implement a flow that takes a list of transactions and returns a list of transactions that have been processed.
The flow is implemented using a Groovy DSL.

## The Assignment: 

 A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
 A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
 (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
 Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
